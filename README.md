# Summary :
- Dash aims to build beautiful web-based analytic and interactive apps.
- We will discover that with only python you can build minimalist web
  app in a very efficient way.
- We also see plotly express which I just dicovered instead of using
  cufflinks.
- We will also learn how to deploy a dash app on Google App Engine.
# About Dash :
- Dash consists in two parts : html layout and callbacks.
- Html layout contains all the inputs and outputs we want to display.
- Inputs could be checkboxes, uploading files area... 
- Outputs could be tables, but in most cases we will use interactive
  plotly figures.
- Callbacks are kind of flask routes to feed our outputs cells in the
  layout with the desired results.
